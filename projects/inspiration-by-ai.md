Interactively describe what you want and work with AI to rapidly find and refine visual examples.

## Key framing note (for us)

Core insight to foreground: **chat is becoming the primary interface for sense-making and creation**.

This product applies that shift to inspiration and early-stage design:

* Instead of searching, scrolling, and bookmarking,
* you *talk* your way into a mood board.

Conversation replaces search queries.
Selection replaces endless browsing.

## Product pitch (working draft)

### User story

When I start a new digital project—especially a website—the first thing I want is a **mood board**.

I want to quickly gather examples that feel right:

* websites,
* layouts,
* maps,
* icon styles,
* tone and structure.

I don’t want to search, filter, and scroll for hours.
I want to **talk my way into a useful reference set**.

---

### The problem

Creating mood boards for digital products is slow and fragmented:

* Inspiration is scattered across search engines, Pinterest, bookmarks, articles, screenshots.
* Each project starts from scratch, even though relevant material already exists.
* Visual tools are good at display, but bad at *intent*.
* Notes about *why* something matters are lost or separated from the reference itself.

What’s missing is a fast, conversational way to assemble a project-specific set of references.

---

### The product

An **AI-first tool for creating mood boards for digital projects**, where chat is the primary interface.

You start by describing what you’re working on:

> “I’m creating a website for X.”

From there, you **converse your way into a board**:

* Ask for examples.
* React to what you see.
* Refine by choosing options.

The system gathers *real references*—not generated images—and assembles them into a simple board or list.

---

### How it works (conceptually)

* **Chat-led discovery**
  You describe, react, refine.

* **Visual options + selection**
  You’re shown concrete examples and choose what resonates.

* **Fast accumulation**
  The goal is speed, not polish.

* **Light annotation**
  Short notes attach directly to references: “use this layout logic”, “tone feels right”.

A board can be as simple as a list of links, images, and notes.

---

### What AI is doing

AI replaces friction, not judgment:

* It finds and groups relevant examples quickly.
* It offers visual refinements as choices, not commands.
* It lets you move forward without formulating perfect search queries.

No image generation is required.

---

### What this is (and isn’t)

This is:

* A fast way to create mood boards for digital products.
* A conversational interface to visual inspiration.
* A lightweight, project-specific tool.

This is not:

* A design or layout tool.
* A generative art system.
* A heavy asset-management platform.

---

### Core value proposition

Create a useful mood board for a digital project in minutes by **talking your way to real examples** instead of searching, scrolling, and bookmarking.

---

### Mental model

ChatGPT for inspiration gathering.
Cursor-style workflows, but for visual references instead of code.
