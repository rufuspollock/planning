A tool that enables real-time collaboration on local files — markdown or anything else — without leaving your preferred editor. It creates a tunnel that syncs a file on disk to connected collaborators' machines, so edits in Vim, VS Code, or any editor show up instantly for others. Optionally syncs to a web page for read-only viewers. Completely editor-agnostic: if you can save to disk, it works.

## Tasks

I want right now I'm on a call with my collaborator Ola and I really want just a document where we can real-time collaborate just to put notes in. But I want that document — I do not want to go into HackMD or even a Google Doc and then have to move it out afterwards so I can use it from the documents I'm using on disc or in GitHub. In fact, the other example I had before, though I'm not using anymore, was GitHub issues where I don't have to copy from a GitHub issue somewhere else, collaborate on it, and then copy it back. I would love to do that.

Now I think we can collaborate almost everywhere from markdown documents or other documents on disc that I'm using with my favourite IDE or Vim. And we really just want is a tunnel — almost like a setup where that file is immediately made available and someone else can just connect their CLI to that tunnel so we get real-time syncing on that document. So then I can be editing the document in my editor, auto-completing, and it's showing up for Ola on her machine. And even better, it also syncs to a web page so someone who's not using either tool could just watch it in real time.

I just want that. I don't want to be in Google Docs to get good collaboration. I just want to have this real-time. I don't want to have to open Obsidian. I almost want it to be neutral to the tool — as long as it's running on disc it just works. If I'm writing the file to disc and saving, it's working.
