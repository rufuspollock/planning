title: Without Hot Air
github: https://github.com/life-itself/climate/tree/main/without-hot-air
---

I already have produced this, but I buried it inside of the climate repo at life-itself. This should get its own website and then get announced, as I did a while ago, actually on Reddit. It might be just an easy way to get some kind of nice traffic in life!

## Tasks

- [ ] Do marketing strategy quickly
- [ ] Evaluate if worth it

Doing it ...

- [ ] register domain withouthotair.org
- [ ] Deploy content there (? with fllowershow)
