I realize now that this kind of planning just makes so much more sense through a prompted interaction process than just brainstorming like this. Also, it should pull from my backlog, but for now, let's try this. 

This was the result of this thread (voice dialog mode): https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-69749fdac8e881918a15a2f66cbda113-planning/c/69774b89-0480-8324-bd4b-ab4c7da980c1?ref=mini

This week’s planning is about **regaining strategic leverage** rather than drifting into low-leverage implementation. The aim is to quickly identify a small number of high-value focuses, externalise the full project landscape, and reduce cognitive load by making implicit work explicit.

## Week plan (current)

- [ ] Life Itself website
  - [ ] Life Itself website brief **✅2026-01-28 i already kind of have this from 2026-01-08, at least next work in https://design.lifeitself.org/plans/plan-next-7d-scqa-2026-01-08.**
  - [ ] Do implementation
    - [x] Delegate website implementation? **✅2026-01-28 i actually think i need to do this for now or it will wait a long while longer.**
      > Well, I think I want to write the brief probably for the website. Actually, that's now clear to me. I want to at least outline what we want to do, why we're doing it, the approach. And the question I have at the moment is the actual implementation I end up, I'm still kind of doing, and I definitely want to get someone to help, like, go through the AI prompting and have that implemented. It takes a certain skill for that, but it's not too great a skill, actually. I wonder how I could efficiently hire that. I already know that, so I don't want to go into that, but I think I'm getting to my answer, like, yeah, I want to have people, someone helping do that. Okay, but I definitely want to write the brief.
- [ ] **Create a "good enough" project backlog**
  - [ ] Identify job story / or need
  - [ ] Outflow all current projects rapidly (no prioritisation yet)
  - [ ] Capture projects as named entities with brief descriptions
  - [ ] Focus on completeness, not execution detail


## Re Life Itself site

- I feel a little bit blocked on the research website because I think it really needs participation from others. Could just draft the content and get review of that, and then the visual style. It would be great to do that in a short sprint with others would be more efficient.
