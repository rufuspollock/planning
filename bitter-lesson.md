# Thread: The Bitter Lesson (Richard S. Sutton)

> **User:** famous ai researchedr statement about just using more data and power is better than anythign else

One of the most widely cited statements in AI research expressing this view comes from Richard S. Sutton, a foundational figure in reinforcement learning. In his 2019 essay *The Bitter Lesson*, Sutton argues that:

> “The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.”

He observes that methods which scale with compute and data consistently outperform approaches that rely on hand-crafted features, domain knowledge, or algorithmic cleverness.

The canonical reference is Richard S. Sutton’s essay *The Bitter Lesson* (2019). Sutton’s core claim is that:

> “General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective.”

He argues that, across decades of AI research, increases in computation and data have repeatedly dominated more elaborate, human-engineered approaches. This perspective is often cited to explain the success of large-scale deep learning systems.
