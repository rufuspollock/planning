## Project backlog for planning and action

Primary job story (core)

When I am planning my work (week planning, reprioritisation, redesigning focus),  
I want a single, explicit backlog of projects and project-level ideas,  
so that I can decide what to work on next without reconstructing context from memory.

Supporting job stories (planning-specific)

- When I am choosing between competing demands,  
  I want to see which projects are active, paused, or latent,  
  so that attention is constrained without losing optionality.

- When I am sequencing work across days or weeks,  
  I want projects to expose candidate next steps or directions (not full task lists),  
  so that planning stays lightweight and generative.

- When I am planning with AI or other systems,  
  I want the backlog to be system-readable and stable,  
  so that reasoning and suggestions operate on shared context rather than ad-hoc explanation.

- When I return to planning after interruption,  
  I want the backlog to quickly re-orient me to “what exists” and “what matters now”,  
  so that planning cost stays low.

Minimum viable backlog implied by these jobs

- A canonical list of projects / project-ideas
- Clear status per project (e.g. active / parked / dormant)
- A short description capturing intent and scope
- Optional lightweight “possible next directions” (not mandatory tasks)


## Project backlog for presentation and narrative coherence

Indicative jobs (secondary for now)

- Publicly catalogue what I have worked on over time
- Present current and past projects coherently to others
- Trace thematic and narrative arcs across years of work
- Make visible continuity, evolution, and discontinuities in my thinking
- Support later curation (websites, profiles, retrospectives)


## Project backlog for capture, parking, and attention control

Indicative jobs

- Capture project ideas without commitment
- Park ideas safely without fear of loss
- Keep non-active projects visible but non-distracting
- Reduce cognitive load by externalising “open loops”
- Allow reactivation when conditions or priorities change
