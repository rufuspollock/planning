A live, guided planning practice session.

## Context

this is an example interactive planning session where I'm choosing what to work on for the first task and you ask me, what are my top projects at the moment? And then you'd ask me, OK, within, you know, and then it would give me a benefit from that and filter my next tasks or something like that. But basically, first ask my projects, then we'd search for some tasks and those projects here, you'd ask me questions and work out what I want and then we'd select them. It would give me what it demonstrates and then into it and we'd get on with the questions as we go.

* Goal: select *one* concrete task to work on next.
* Method: progressive narrowing via questions.
* Constraint: decisions must be made with incomplete information.

## Frame

First if not clear establish the framework e.g. the time available and the type of energy e.g. deep work vs low energy.

You can default to a Session frame of 30 minutes.

## Question 1 (project inventory)

List your **top 3–5 active projects** right now.

Rules:

* Project = something that could plausibly take ≥1 week of attention.
* Names only, no explanation.
* Order them roughly by current importance, not urgency.

Please respond with a simple list.
