This is a sample interaction of doing planning with an AI assistant.

### Framing an interactive 30-minute planning practice

> Okay, that's great. Chat, I wanna try a different approach right now. I wanna try a system where we actually interact together to... I want you to actually match with us doing interactive session with you, I'll ask me questions, so I find a site to work the project right now. So that might be the same certain projects I could work on, and then you ask me questions, and then I decide, and I can start out with the constraints. So it's actually more like a practice session. I do wanna do planning each day. So let's start with that and the constraint right now, because I have, let's say, 30 minutes and... yeah, we'll start with that constraint for 30 minutes. I'm gonna train my Wi-Fi is okay, I do have my laptop, so...

Assistant response:

Understood. We will treat this as a live, guided planning practice, with no reference to Taskhopper as a product.

Session frame (30 minutes)

* Goal: select *one* concrete task to work on next.
* Method: progressive narrowing via questions.
* Constraint: decisions must be made with incomplete information.

Question 1 (project inventory)
List your **top 3–5 active projects** right now.

Rules:

* Project = something that could plausibly take ≥1 week of attention.
* Names only, no explanation.
* Order them roughly by current importance, not urgency.

Please respond with a simple list.

### Listing current active projects

> Okay, so there's the Life Itself research website, there's the Life Itself website, there's reports that matter, there's my backlog of projects, and there's this task for our app I'm doing right now to figure out what task I should actually work on. That's what I can immediately think of. And there's Life Itself's strategic plan for the year, and that's about six top tasks, about six major projects, maybe five.
>
> this is not ordered. i can come to that next.

Assistant response:

Good. We’ll proceed to narrowing.

Question 2 (ordering by leverage, not guilt)
Please order these projects from **highest to lowest leverage right now**, where leverage means: “progress here makes other things easier or clearer.”

Use the same items you listed, numbered 1 (highest leverage) to 6 (lowest).
No explanation yet—just the ordering.

---

### Clarifying and reviewing the project list

> Just list them out for me as a bulleted list so I can review them.

Assistant response:

Here is the set you named, listed plainly so you can review and reorder:

* Life Itself research website
* Life Itself website
* Life Itself strategic plan for the year
* Reports That Matter
* Backlog of projects
* Meta-task: deciding what task to work on now (planning / task-selection practice)

Once you’ve reviewed this list, your next move is to **number them 1–6 by leverage** (highest leverage = 1).

---

### Ordering projects by leverage

> Probably the life is our strategic plan for the year and the meta task, followed by the backlog of projects. Backlog projects and meta tasks will go together, but probably the meta task and the life is our strategic plan.

Assistant response:

Good. I’ll normalize that into an explicit ordering so we can act.

Current leverage order (interpreted):

1. Life Itself strategic plan for the year
2. Meta-task: deciding what to work on now (planning practice)
3. Backlog of projects
4. Life Itself research website
5. Life Itself website
6. Reports That Matter

Now we narrow to *this* 30-minute block.

Question 3 (scope gate)
Which of the **top two** can produce a *meaningful, finished artifact* in 30 minutes?

Choose one:

* A. Life Itself strategic plan
* B. Meta-task (planning system / practice)

Answer with **A or B only**.

---

### Assessing realistic progress in 30 minutes

> I think I can do much, so I should strategic plan in 30 minutes, but I can make progress on the meta talk and the backlog of projects.

Assistant response:

Agreed. We will choose something that *moves structure*, not content.

Decision (based on your answer)
→ Focus: **Meta-task + backlog**, in service of the strategic plan later.

Now we lock the 30-minute outcome.

Question 4 (concrete outcome)
At the end of 30 minutes, which *finished artifact* would be most useful?

Choose one:

* A. A **ranked backlog**: top 10 projects ordered by leverage
* B. A **decision rule** you can reuse daily to choose what to work on
* C. A **single next task** clearly defined and ready to start
* D. A **one-page snapshot** of “what I’m working on and why”

Answer with **A, B, C, or D only**.

---

### Choosing the outcome: next tasks

> C. though best would be a list of 3-4 next tasks

Assistant response:

Good. We’ll do **C+**: a *short, committed next-task set*.

Rule for this session:

* You will leave with **3–4 concrete next tasks**.
* Each must be doable in ≤90 minutes.
* No “thinking about” tasks.

Question 5 (task sourcing)
Where should these tasks come from **right now**?

Choose one:

* A. Only from the **Life Itself strategic plan**
* B. Only from the **backlog of projects**
* C. One from each of your top 3 leverage areas
* D. Whatever feels most alive *today*, regardless of project

Answer with **A, B, C, or D**.

### Refining task grain and source

> Just to say, I think I prefer tasks, what I would call the micro-tasks, to probably take me only like 5, well, 10 minutes to 15 minutes, maybe up to 30 minutes. But something which is a 90-minute task, unless it's a deep work item, I prefer to call it a task set or task grouping. And right now, where has this task come from right now? Well, this is why I'm doing the meta-task work. I guess it would be the strategic plan. I don't feel very cool with the strategic plan, but I feel I need to do it with others. So I think it's maybe not great, but I could be writing up what I have at the moment and creating an agenda, actually, for Sylvie. That would be useful to review what I have, create an agenda for a few of the topics to cover with Sylvie, and even a structure of maybe prompts that we could go through that would help us develop the strategic plan. That's actually a good idea. And the other would be developing my backlog of projects that could be published on my website.

Assistant response:

Good—this clarifies the grain size and source.

I’ll translate what you said into **candidate micro-tasks**, then ask you to commit.

Proposed next-task set (micro, 10–30 min each):

From the strategic plan (solo, preparatory):

1. Write a **1-page current-state dump** of the Life Itself strategic plan (what exists now, no fixing).
2. Draft a **30–45 min agenda for a strategy session with Sylvie** (topics + timeboxes).
3. Write **5–7 concrete prompts/questions** to guide that session (e.g. priorities, constraints, success criteria).

From the backlog:
4. Produce a **raw list of projects** that could plausibly be published on your website (names only, no descriptions).

Question 6 (commitment)

* Do you want to keep **all four**, or
* Cut this to **three** (if so, which one goes)?

Reply with either:

* “All four”, or
* “Three: drop #__”.

### Narrowing to strategic-plan preparation tasks

> I actually wanna focus on 2 and 3 from the strategic plan. I think I'm only gonna do one or other of these in the 30 minutes. I'm not gonna do both. So, um, yeah, let's do 2 and 3 from the strategic plan.

Assistant response:

Good. We’ll narrow to **one** and execute cleanly.

Between these two:

2. Draft a **30–45 min agenda** for a strategy session with Sylvie
3. Write **5–7 prompts/questions** to guide that session

Decision principle:

* If you want *structure and containment* → agenda.
* If you want *quality of thinking* → prompts.

Question 7 (final choice)
Which do you do **now**, in this 30-minute block?

Answer with **2 (agenda)** or **3 (prompts)**.

---

### Reframing around definition of done for strategy

> If you want to focus on what the definition of done is for strategic work, what does it actually mean for that to be done, what are the kind of questions that would have been answered, that would be very helpful, actually, right, which I think the agenda and the prompts come out of that.

Assistant response:

Excellent—that reframes the task cleanly.

We will do **one meta-micro-task** now:

Task (this 30-minute block):
Define **“Definition of Done for the Life Itself strategic plan.”**

Output (what “done” means *today*):
A short list of **8–10 questions** such that, *if they were answered*, you would say:

> “Yes, the strategy is sufficiently done to move forward with confidence.”

No agenda, no prose, no solutions—just the questions.
