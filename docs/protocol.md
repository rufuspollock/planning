# Daily 30-Minute Planning Protocol (Interactive, Solo or with AI)

### 0. Set the frame (1 minute)

* Time available: ___ minutes
* Energy level: Low / Medium / High
* Constraint: decisions with incomplete information

Write at the top of the page:

> “The goal of this session is to choose what to work on *next*.”

---

### 1. Project inventory (3 minutes)

List **3–6 active projects**.

Rules:

* Each project plausibly takes ≥1 week
* Names only
* No justification

---

### 2. Order by leverage (3 minutes)

Order the projects **highest → lowest leverage**, where leverage =

> “Progress here makes other things easier or clearer.”

Do not optimize; go with first-pass intuition.

---

### 3. Scope gate (2 minutes)

Ask:

> “Which of the top two could produce a *finished artifact* today?”

Choose **one focus area** for this session.
If none can → default to **meta-work** (planning, backlog, clarification).

---

### 4. Choose the outcome type (2 minutes)

Decide what you want to leave with *today*:

* A. Ranked list
* B. Reusable decision rule
* C. 3–4 concrete next micro-tasks
* D. Definition of Done (questions)

Default choice: **C**.
If stuck or uneasy: **D**.

---

### 5. Define task grain (1 minute)

Set task size explicitly:

* Micro-task = 10–30 minutes
* Anything bigger = task set (not allowed today)

Write:

> “Today’s tasks must be startable immediately.”

---

### 6. Generate candidate tasks (8–10 minutes)

Generate **4–6 candidate micro-tasks** from the chosen focus.

Rules:

* Verb-first (“Draft…”, “List…”, “Outline…”)
* No “think about”
* No dependencies you can’t control

---

### 7. Commit (3 minutes)

Select **3–4 tasks maximum**.

Apply the cut test:

> “If I only did *one* of these today, which would still make this day count?”

Star that one.

---

### 8. Start immediately (hard rule)

Do **not** review the list again.

Start the starred task for **10 minutes** immediately.

---

## Fallback protocol (when foggy or blocked)

Skip to this prompt and answer it:

> “When this work is *done enough*, what questions would I be able to answer confidently?”

List **5–10 questions**.
Then return to step 6 and derive tasks from the questions.

---

## Definition of success for the protocol

* You start real work within 30 minutes.
* You stop planning before it feels “complete.”
* Tomorrow is easier because of today.

# Call-and-response script for AI-guided use

Below is a **call-and-response script** you can run verbatim with an AI (or self-prompt) each day.
It is optimized for **clarity, speed, and momentum**, not reflection.

You answer **only what is asked**; the AI does the narrowing.
